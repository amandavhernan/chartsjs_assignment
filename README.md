## Design Brief

For this assignment, I decided to source climate change-related data from the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to create three different graphics: a stacked bar chart, a line chart, and a polar area chart. I visualized global greenhouse gas emissions, temperature anomalies in the United States, and wildfire frequency in the United States. My goal for this series of graphics was to provide a more compressive look at climate change and how global trends, such as greenhouse gas emissions, affect climate/temperature and wildfire frequency in the United States. I also used a yellow/orange/red color scheme throughout to differentiate between different variables and to make the graphics more cohesive. I chose these colors because they're often used to visually represent heat and fire, which closely relates to climate change. Some of the questions I set out to answer were: 

* How do rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions affect wildfire frequency in the United States?
* Is there a relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and rising surface temperatures?
* How much has the average surface temperature in the United States changed over time?
* How many wildfires per year does the United States see on average? Does there appear to be a relationship with changes to the country's average surface temperature?
* Which greenhouse gas is the most prevalent in global emissions? Have greenhouse gas emissions changed over time, and by how much?
